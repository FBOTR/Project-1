# Baseball Regression

This program takes historical data over the last 20 years from across the league, with special attention paid towards the Yankees, to find the correlation between different statistics and how it is related to their win percentage that season. 

Based on these statistics we can learn more about what makes a team better and whats the Yankee's rely on to win. This data can then be used to create a metric and then run it through a Monte Carlo simulation to predict the win percentage based on correlated stats. 

**Step 1:** Download BaseballStatsYankees_template.xlsx 

**Step 2:** Place in MatLab Folder 

**Step 3:** Run the Regression algorithm 

**Step 4:** Run the Monte Carlo Simulation

**Step 5:** Make Money (Hopefully).
